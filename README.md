 
Network Traffic Analyzer
üìå Project Overview
The Network Traffic Analyzer is a tool designed to monitor, capture, and analyze network packets. It helps users gain insights into network activity, detect anomalies, and troubleshoot network issues. This project is useful for cybersecurity professionals, network administrators, and researchers interested in analyzing network behavior.

üöÄ Features
Packet Capturing: Monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic in real time.
Protocol Analysis: Identifies and categorizes different network protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.).
Traffic Statistics: Provides insights into data transmission rates, packet sizes, and more.
Filtering & Searching: Allows filtering packets by IP, protocol, port, or other criteria.
Visualization: Displays network traffic trends using graphs and tables.
Security Monitoring: Detects suspicious or potentially malicious activity.
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python (with Scapy, PyShark) or Rust (Tokio, Pcap)
Network Libraries: Wireshark, Nmap, Scapy, or Tshark
Visualization: Matplotlib, Dash, or Grafana for traffic insights
